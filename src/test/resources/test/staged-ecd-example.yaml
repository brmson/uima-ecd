# Experiment Configuration Descriptor

# The following sections are required: 
# experiment, collection-reader, pipeline and post-process

# Each resource should be specified either as:
#  inherit or class:

# -inherit- will look for a file WITHIN the classpath 
# on the directory specified by the doted syntax 
#  a.b.c => a/b/c 
# inherited properties can be overridden directly 
# on the body of the declaration

# -class- will look for a class on the classpath, and is 
# intended as a shortcut for classes that might not have 
# default configuration parameters

# When the attributes are specified as a resource
# to be loaded on an annotator, they should be specified 
# as [class|inherit]!fully.qualified.resource

# A pipeline is typically defined by phases that inherit
# from base.phase, this element provides all the book keeping 
# functionality for experimentation.
# Elements that need to collect information form the different
# experiment options can be specified at the end of the pipeline.

# Besides these elements, any AnalysisEngine or CasConsumer 
# can be added to the pipeline in a similar way. 

# Some options within a phase can have combinatorial options
# for a detailed example see: example.third-phase-annotator

# A final note on YAML syntax, indentation is relevant to
# determine nesting of elements and some characters 
# are reserved (-,:) so use quotes "" to use them on strings
